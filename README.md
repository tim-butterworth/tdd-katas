## TDD Code Katas

# Purpose

These TDD code katas are meant to be bite-size puzzles that allow us to focus on TDD without alot of distracting frameworks.

# Rules

The rules are the same rules as TDD, namely:

Write a test before writing implementation
Write only enough implementation to make the test pass
Once the test is passing, refactor the code as needed (don't refactor while tests are failing)

Some bonus psudo-rules:

You can generally write code to fix compilation errors, but no more than absolutely required
The person who writes the test should not be the person who makes the test pass
