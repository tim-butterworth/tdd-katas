## Plink Plonk Plunk

This kata is a more advanced version of Fizz Buzz.  Every number has a sound (except the numbers that don't).

If a number is divisible by 3 it makes a `Plink` sound.
If a number is divisible by 5 it makes a `Plonk` sound.
If a number is divisible by 7 it makes a `Plunk` sound.

Any number not divisible by 3, 5, or 7 should be returned as its value as a string.

If a number is divisible by more than one of 3, 5, or 7 the combined strings should be returned with `Plink` always coming before the other two and `Plonk` coming before `Plunk`.
