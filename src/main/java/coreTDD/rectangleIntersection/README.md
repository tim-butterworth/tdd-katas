## Rectangle Intersection

This exercise is about detecting if two rectangles overlap.  The rectangles are all made exclusively of vertical and horizontal lines (no rotated rectangles), and they can be specified using either pair of diagonal corners.

If two rectangles overlap, IntersectionDetector.rectangleIntersection should return true, if they don't overlap, it should return false.
There are a bunch of cases to consider, after you think you have accounted for them all, it might be a good idea to check with another pair to see if you missed any.
