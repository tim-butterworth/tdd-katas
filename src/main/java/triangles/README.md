## Triangle Kata

There are three kinds of triangles (depending on how you categorize them):

- `EQUILATERAL` - all sides are the same length
- `SCALENE` - all sides are different lengths
- `ISOSCELES` - exactly two sides are the same length

The goal of this kata is to implement a method that can identify each type of triangle given three Integer side lengths.
There is the possibility that the set of sides are not a valid triangle, in that case `INVALID` should be returned.
