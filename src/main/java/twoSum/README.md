## Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specified target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Examples

GIVEN: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
RETURN: [0, 1] because 2 + 7 = 9
