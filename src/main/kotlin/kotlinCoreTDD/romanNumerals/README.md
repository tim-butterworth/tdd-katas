# Roman Numeral Kata

This is a special time when we get to laugh at those who came before us, and who better to laugh at then the Romans? The Romans had a rediculous numbering system and in order for us to laugh at them in a more informed way, one should implement a Roman Numeral to Integer converter.

The rules of Roman Numerals are too many, and here they are:

I -> 1
V -> 5
X -> 10
L -> 50
C -> 100
D -> 500
M -> 1,000

Typical Case:

The numbers are generally written left to right, biggest to smallest, and simply added together.

Subtractive Case:

Sometimes a smaller symbol is written before larger symbols, in that case, the value of the smaller symbol is subtracted from the larger symbol.

for example:

IV = 4
IX = 9
XL = 40

For the purposes of this exercise, the converter only needs to support numbers up to 3,000.
